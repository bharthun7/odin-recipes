    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For restaurant-level, perfectly cooked New York strip steak in 20 minutes, sear it in a super hot cast-iron skillet and finish it in the oven.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 New York strip steak - 8 ounces, 1-inch thick</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper - freshly ground </li>
        <li>½ tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>
        <li>Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat until smoking hot, 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, blot the steak dry with paper towels and sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the steak in the hot skillet. Cook, without moving, for 2 minutes on each side. This will create a nice crust. Cook the fat strip for 30 more seconds.</li>
        <li>Using oven mitts, transfer the skillet to the hot oven. Roast the steak for 3-4 minutes for medium rare (135°F) or 4-5 minutes for medium (145°F). Check with an instant-read thermometer to make sure the steak is done to your liking. If not, keep it in the oven until it is.</li>
        <li>Place the steak on a plate. Loosely cover it with foil. Allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then top it with butter and serve.</li>
    </ol>
