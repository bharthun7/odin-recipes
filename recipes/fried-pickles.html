    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Today we're making homemade Fried Pickles WITHOUT a deep fryer! My recipe
      makes a big batch of perfectly crisp, breaded dill pickle slices in just
      20 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup (125 g) all purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>½ cup (118 ml) buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>
        3 kosher dill pickles cut into slices just shy of ¼” thick and lightly
        patted dry
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan 2-3" deep with oil for
        frying. Fix a frying thermometer to the edge (make sure it is in the oil
        but not touching the bottom of the pan) and set your heat to medium. Oil
        will need to reach 375F (190C) before you can begin frying, but this
        will take 10 minutes or so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, prepare your breading mixture by whisking together flour,
        salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk and egg.</li>
      <li>
        Once oil has reached 375F (190C), prepare pickles for frying in batches
        of 3-4 slices
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat slices in flour mixture, gengly shake off excess, dredge in
        buttermilk/egg mixture, then coat with flour mixture again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer (carefully!) to oil and fry 3-4 pickle slices at a time for 90
        seconds on each side or until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a slotted spoon or strainer to remove from oil and transfer to a
        paper towel lined plate. Make sure oil returns to 375F (190C) before
        frying your next batch of pickles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fried pickles are best enjoyed warm. If desired, serve with dipping
        sauce, which can be made by stirring together all of the dipping sauce
        ingredients until combined.
